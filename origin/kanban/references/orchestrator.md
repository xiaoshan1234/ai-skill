# Kanban Orchestrator — Decomposition Playbook

> The core worker lifecycle (including the `kanban_create` fan-out pattern and the
> "decompose, don't execute" rule) is auto-injected into every kanban process via
> the `KANBAN_GUIDANCE` system-prompt block. This skill is the deeper playbook when

## Profiles are user-configured — not a fixed roster

Hermes setups vary widely. Some users run a single profile that does everything; some
run a small fleet (`docker-worker`, `cron-worker`); some run a curated specialist team
they've named themselves. There is **no default specialist roster** — the orchestrator
skill does not know what profiles exist on this machine.

Before fanning out, you must ground the decomposition in the profiles that actually
exist. The dispatcher silently fails to spawn unknown assignee names — it doesn't
autocorrect, doesn't suggest, doesn't fall back. So a card assigned to `researcher` on
a setup that only has `docker-worker` just sits in `ready` forever.

**Step 0: discover available profiles before planning.**

Use one of these:

- `hermes profile list` — prints the table of profiles configured on this machine.
- `kanban_list(assignee="<some-name>")` — sanity-check a single name. Returns empty
  for an unknown assignee.
- **Just ask the user.** "What profiles do you have set up?" is a fine first turn.

## When to use the board (vs. just doing the work)

Create Kanban tasks when any of these are true:

1. **Multiple specialists are needed.** Research + analysis + writing is three profiles.
2. **The work should survive a crash or restart.** Long-running, recurring, or important.
3. **The user might want to interject.** Human-in-the-loop at any step.
4. **Multiple subtasks can run in parallel.** Fan-out for speed.
5. **Review / iteration is expected.** A reviewer profile loops on drafter output.
6. **The audit trail matters.** Board rows persist in SQLite forever.

If *none* of those apply — it's a small one-shot reasoning task — use `delegate_task`
instead or answer the user directly.

## The anti-temptation rules

Your job description says "route, don't execute." The rules that enforce that:

- **Do not execute the work yourself.** Your restricted toolset usually doesn't even
  include terminal/file/code/web for implementation. If you find yourself "just fixing
  this quickly" — stop and create a task for the right specialist.
- **For any concrete task, create a Kanban task and assign it.** Every single time.
- **Split multi-lane requests before creating cards.** A user prompt can contain several
  independent workstreams. Extract those lanes first, then create one card per lane.
- **Run independent lanes in parallel.** If two cards do not need each other's output,
  leave them unlinked so the dispatcher can fan them out. Link only true data dependencies.
- **Never create dependent work as independent ready cards.** If a card must wait for
  another card, pass `parents=[...]` in the original `kanban_create` call.
- **If no specialist fits the available profiles, ask the user.** Do not invent
  profile names; the dispatcher will silently drop unknown assignees.

## Decomposition playbook

### Step 1 — Understand the goal

Ask clarifying questions if the goal is ambiguous. Cheap to ask; expensive to spawn
the wrong fleet.

### Step 2 — Sketch the task graph

Before creating anything, draft the graph out loud. Treat every concrete workstream as
a candidate card:

1. Extract the lanes from the request.
2. Map each lane to one of the profiles you discovered in Step 0.
3. Decide whether each lane is independent or gated by another lane.
4. Create independent lanes as parallel cards with no parent links.
5. Create synthesis/review/integration cards with parent links to the lanes they
   depend on. A child created with unfinished parents starts in `todo`; the
   dispatcher promotes it to `ready` only after every parent is done.

Show the graph to the user before creating cards. Let them correct it.

### Step 3 — Create tasks and link

```python
t1 = kanban_create(
    title="research: Postgres cost vs current",
    assignee="<profile-A>",
    body="Compare estimated infrastructure costs, migration costs, and ongoing ops...",
    tenant=os.environ.get("HERMES_TENANT"),
)["task_id"]

t2 = kanban_create(
    title="research: Postgres performance vs current",
    assignee="<profile-A>",  # same profile, run in parallel
    body="Compare query latency, throughput, and scaling characteristics...",
)["task_id"]

t3 = kanban_create(
    title="synthesize migration recommendation",
    assignee="<profile-B>",
    body="Read the findings from T1 (cost) and T2 (performance). Produce a recommendation.",
    parents=[t1, t2],
)["task_id"]
```

`parents=[...]` gates promotion — children stay in `todo` until every parent reaches
`done`, then auto-promote to `ready`.

### Step 4 — Complete your own task

```python
kanban_complete(
    summary="decomposed into T1-T4: 2 research lanes in parallel, 1 synthesis...",
    metadata={
        "task_graph": {
            "T1": {"assignee": "<profile-A>", "parents": []},
            "T2": {"assignee": "<profile-A>", "parents": []},
            "T3": {"assignee": "<profile-B>", "parents": ["T1", "T2"]},
        },
    },
)
```

### Step 5 — Report back to the user

Tell them what you created in plain prose, naming the actual profiles you used.

## Common patterns

**Fan-out + fan-in:** N research-style cards with no parents, one synthesis card with
all of them as parents.

**Parallel implementation + validation:** one implementer card + one
explorer/researcher card for verification. A reviewer card can depend on both.

**Pipeline with gates:** `planner → implementer → reviewer`. Each stage's
`parents=[previous_task]`.

**Human-in-the-loop:** Any task can `kanban_block()` to wait for input.

## Goal-mode cards (persistent workers)

For open-ended cards where one turn rarely finishes the job, pass `goal_mode=True`:

```python
kanban_create(
    title="Translate the full docs site to French",
    body="Acceptance: every page translated, no English left, links intact.",
    assignee="<translator-profile>",
    goal_mode=True,
    goal_max_turns=15,
)["task_id"]
```

After each worker turn, a judge evaluates the response against the card's
title + body. Not done + budget remains → worker keeps going in the same session.
Budget exhausted without completion → the card is blocked for human review.

## Recovering stuck workers

When a worker keeps crashing, hallucinating, or getting blocked:

1. **Reclaim** — abort the running worker and reset the task to `ready`.
2. **Reassign** — switch the task to a different profile with fresh worker.
3. **Change profile model** — edit profile config, then Reclaim to retry.

## Pitfalls

- **Inventing profile names that don't exist.** Dispatcher silently fails — always
  assign to a profile from Step 0 discovery.
- **Bundling independent lanes into one card.** Create two cards for two independent
  outcomes.
- **Over-linking because of wording.** "Finally check X" may still be parallel if
  X is static config or docs.
- **Forgetting dependency links.** Use parent links so implement/review cannot run
  before their inputs exist.
- **Reassignment vs. new task.** If a reviewer blocks with "needs changes," create
  a NEW task — don't re-run the same task.
- **Argument order for links.** `kanban_link(parent_id=..., child_id=...)` — parent first.
